# D3D-Lighting
 Just a simple project that I've made to test my knowledge in topics like lighting, fog, etc.

# How to run and compile
Open the project in Visual Studio 2019 and compile. The default settings should be enough to run this project.

#### Technical notes:
- If you try to run directly from the executable (after compiling) you will need to add the Textures folder to the same directory as the executable.
- You may only compile in x86 depending on your system.
- If you're using an older version of Visual Studio, make sure to select the available Windows SDK and Toolset versions on project properties.
- Also make sure to select all of the .cpp and .h files and set "Included in Project" to True.

# Known issues
- You can look up/down until you flip the camera upside down.
- There's no conventional way to close the application (don't worry, you can just press ALT+F4 or ALT+TAB and then close).
